    "description": "Discover our second house in Paris, Gambetta 11. Gambetta 11 is 1 minute from the Gambetta metro station and bus connections but there’s everything you need on your doorstep! Bars, restaurants, shops, theaters, supermarkets, all within walking distance. Take a stroll through the park, or down to the Père Lachaise Cemetery, to have a (probably one-sided) chat with Edith Piaf, Oscar Wilde, or even Jim Morrison. We’ve taken a beautiful house, found space for a cinema, a gym, and a laundry room. We’ve only put in 11 bedrooms (5 with private bathrooms), so you’ll get to know everyone in no time! But here’s the fun part, we’ve added one floor to the building, with a huge open kitchen and living space, and a roof terrace! Perfect for summer brunch or after-work beers with your housemates. The following amenities and services are included: \n- BBQ and outdoor area.\n- Cable TV.\n- Chill out and dining area.\n- Cleaning (common areas)\n- Coworking and work areas. \n- Dryer and Washer.\n- Fast WiFi.\n- Gym / Fitness Studio.\n- Heating.\n- Iron.\n- Fully equipped shared kitchen with all the essentials.\n- Parking (chargeable).\n- Parties (arranged).\n- Soap and toilet paper.\n- Access to terrace.\nThis is what living in Paris with us looks like.",

Eligible for all housing assistance, like APL.\n\nThis beautiful coliving house spans five floors and has a stunning interior courtyard. Some rooms are equipped with wooden floors, which add charm to the textured design of the spaces.\n\nWe have split the common areas so the kitchen and the dining room are on the first floor, which allows a lot of light and gives the space a very nice atmosphere. Both rooms are spacious, with a huge central island in the kitchen perfect for sharing moments.\n\nThe gym is in the basement if you want to get your sweat on, and the multiple floors help provide privacy and separation when needed. The back of the house offers a large outdoor space complete with a huge table, and there’s even a place to park your bike.",
