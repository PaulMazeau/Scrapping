    "description": "Discover our second house in Paris, Gambetta 11. Gambetta 11 is 1 minute from the Gambetta metro station and bus connections but there’s everything you need on your doorstep! Bars, restaurants, shops, theaters, supermarkets, all within walking distance. Take a stroll through the park, or down to the Père Lachaise Cemetery, to have a (probably one-sided) chat with Edith Piaf, Oscar Wilde, or even Jim Morrison. We’ve taken a beautiful house, found space for a cinema, a gym, and a laundry room. We’ve only put in 11 bedrooms (5 with private bathrooms), so you’ll get to know everyone in no time! But here’s the fun part, we’ve added one floor to the building, with a huge open kitchen and living space, and a roof terrace! Perfect for summer brunch or after-work beers with your housemates. The following amenities and services are included: \n- BBQ and outdoor area.\n- Cable TV.\n- Chill out and dining area.\n- Cleaning (common areas)\n- Coworking and work areas. \n- Dryer and Washer.\n- Fast WiFi.\n- Gym / Fitness Studio.\n- Heating.\n- Iron.\n- Fully equipped shared kitchen with all the essentials.\n- Parking (chargeable).\n- Parties (arranged).\n- Soap and toilet paper.\n- Access to terrace.\nThis is what living in Paris with us looks like.",
